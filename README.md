# LiquidityModels

Here is a comprehensive workflow for your GitHub repository's README.md file, designed to detail your automated trading project that will contain your Opening Range Breakout (ORB), Continuation, and Gap Fill strategies, along with backtesting and historical data. This structure aims to be thorough, professional, and directly supported by the insights from our conversation history and the provided sources.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Project Overview
This repository houses the development and implementation of automated trading strategies, focusing on Opening Range Breakout (ORB), Continuation, and Gap Fill models. The core objective is to translate subjective trading ideas into objective, unambiguous rules that can be executed by a computer program [P1, 79, 83, 184]. This project leverages extensive historical market data, rigorous backtesting, and a deep understanding of underlying market mechanics and liquidity concepts to identify and exploit a statistical edge.
The project's philosophy is rooted in the recognition that successful trading requires a verifiable edge against typically efficient and random markets. It emphasizes the importance of time-based delivery, manipulation, and understanding order flow as described in Benjamin's boot camp, and the scientific methodology advocated by Aronson for evaluating technical analysis.
2. Core Trading Strategies
Each strategy implemented here is meticulously defined with objective rules for entry, exit, and risk management.
2.1. Opening Range Breakout (ORB)
•
Definition: The Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategy is based on the high and low of the first hour of a market's trading session, typically from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM Eastern Time for the US equities market. This range is known as the Initial Balance (IB). The ORB is monitored as a breakout area for range extension traders.
•
Concept: Price breaking out of this initial range often indicates a strong directional bias for the rest of the day, suggesting a continuation rather than a reversal. This is a classical pattern, and its study involves understanding historical tendencies of market price movements relative to the open.
•
Implementation Focus:
◦
Identifying the IB High and IB Low.
◦
Detecting unambiguous breakouts above the IB High or below the IB Low.
◦
Analysing probabilities of daily close above/below the IB based on breakout direction, anticipating continuation (e.g., 63% probability of closing above IB High on breakout days).
◦
Incorporating expected retracements into the IB range after a breakout (e.g., 65% of the time price retraces 25% back into IB) for better entry points, while also defining invalidation levels (e.g., 50% retracement) for stop-loss placement.
2.2. Continuation Strategy (Benjamin's Primary Model)
This strategy is an advanced model based on identifying manipulation and trading the subsequent distribution, heavily emphasizing time-based market delivery and liquidity concepts. It represents a "reversal model" based on specific time windows.
•
Underlying Principles:
◦
Time-Based Logic: Time is the paramount factor for profitability. Key times (e.g., 8:30 AM, 9:30 AM, 10:00 AM, 10:30 AM) serve as "storytellers" or "hints" about market direction, while "macros" (e.g., 9:50-10:10 AM, 11:50-12:10 PM) are the high-probability windows for finding trade setups and where manipulation is likely to occur.
◦
Manipulation: Every market move involves manipulation; price will often fake out traders (e.g., by taking liquidity) before delivering a true directional move. Identifying the end of manipulation is key.
◦
Higher Time Frame Narrative: The overarching bias and target for price movement must be established from higher time frames. Lower time frame actions are interpreted within this broader context.
◦
Draw on Liquidity: Price is constantly seeking liquidity, which can be categorized into two main types:
▪
Internal Range Liquidity: Such as Fair Value Gaps (FVG), Inversion Fair Value Gaps (IFVG), Volume Imbalances, and New Day/Week Opening Gaps. These are inefficiencies price tends to rebalance.
▪
External Range Liquidity: Consists of obvious highs and lows, including equal highs and equal lows. Price is drawn to these levels to take out orders.
•
Entry Model Components (Reversal Model): The sequence for a high-probability entry involves:
1.
Narrative & Manipulation at Key Time: Price manipulates (e.g., takes liquidity) at a "storyteller" time (e.g., 9:30 AM) to establish the narrative for the day.
2.
Break of Structure (BOS) / Market Structure Shift (MSS): After manipulation, price forms a break of structure (high-low-lower high-lower low for bearish, vice versa for bullish). This confirms the manipulation is over and the true direction is established.
3.
Fair Value Gap (FVG) Entry: Within the structure formed by the BOS/MSS, a Fair Value Gap (an inefficiency from a three-candlestick pattern) is identified.
4.
Consequent Encroachment (CE) Respect: For a high-probability FVG, price must respect its 50% midline (Consequent Encroachment). Bodies closing under/above the CE indicates likely continuation in that direction.
5.
Macro Time Window Entry: The entry into the FVG must occur during a high-probability macro time window (e.g., 9:50-10:10 AM).
2.3. Gap Fill Strategy
•
Definition: This strategy specifically targets Fair Value Gaps (FVGs), which are defined as inefficiencies in price action represented by a three-candlestick pattern where the first and third candlesticks do not overlap, leaving a "gap". Bullish FVGs (Buy-Side Imbalance Sell-Side Inefficiency - BISI) imply a need for price to rebalance lower, and bearish FVGs (Sell-Side Imbalance Buy-Side Inefficiency - SIBI) imply a need for price to rebalance higher.
•
Concept: Markets tend to "fill" these gaps or "rebalance" these inefficiencies, similar to a paint roller filling in empty spots on a wall. They are a form of internal range liquidity that price is drawn to.
•
Implementation Focus:
◦
Precise identification of FVGs (both bullish and bearish) using a three-candlestick pattern where wicks do not overlap.
◦
Evaluating the "consequent encroachment" (50% midline) of the FVG as a key indicator for whether price will respect the gap and continue in its intended direction or disrespect it.
◦
Considering "inversion fair value gaps" where a disregarded FVG then acts as support/resistance in the opposite direction, especially after taking liquidity or breaking structure.
◦
Distinguishing between Fair Value Gaps and "liquidity voids" (larger gaps).
◦
Integrating the FVG analysis with higher time frame narrative to avoid "fake" setups on lower time frames.
3. Data Requirements & Management
•
Historical Data:
◦
Type: The project requires comprehensive historical market data including Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) prices, Volume (V), and precise Timestamps for various instruments (e.g., futures, equities, forex) [Conversation History].
◦
Granularity: Data across multiple time frames (e.g., 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute, hourly, daily) is essential. Higher time frames are crucial for narrative and bias, while lower time frames are used for precise entries.
◦
Storage: Raw historical data will be stored efficiently for quick access and processing during backtesting.
•
Data Sources: (Placeholder: specify the actual data providers or APIs used, e.g., Polygon.io, Interactive Brokers API, etc.)
•
Data Preparation: This involves cleaning, normalising, and structuring raw data for use by the strategy algorithms.
4. Backtesting & Evaluation Framework
The heart of validating these strategies lies in a robust backtesting framework that adheres to scientific principles.
•
Objectivity: All strategies are implemented as objective, mechanical trading rules that produce unambiguous market positions (long, short, or neutral). This eliminates subjective interpretation.
•
Execution Assumption: When backtesting, entries and exits are assumed to occur at the next legitimate price point after a signal is generated (e.g., next day's open for daily signals) to avoid "look-ahead bias" or "future information leakage". Trading costs, including commissions and slippage, are accounted for to reflect real-world performance.
•
Performance Metrics: The backtesting engine will generate detailed trade-by-trade results and aggregate performance metrics, including:
◦
Gross and Net Profit/Loss (P&L) [Conversation History, 82, 99].
◦
Win Rate and Loss Rate (percentage of profitable trades) [Conversation History, 82, 99].
◦
Average Win, Average Loss, and Win/Loss Ratio [Conversation History, 82, 99].
◦
Maximum Drawdown and other risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe Ratio) [Conversation History, 222].
◦
Number of Trades.
•
Addressing Data Mining Bias: A critical concern in strategy development is data mining bias, where observed profitability might be due to chance rather than a true edge. To mitigate this:
◦
Out-of-Sample Testing: A portion of the historical data not used for developing or optimising the rules will be reserved for testing the final strategy, providing an unbiased estimate of future performance [Conversation History, 202, 213].
◦
Walk-Forward Testing: This dynamic approach will be employed using a moving data window, divided into "training" and "testing" sets. The model's parameters are "learned" in the training data and then evaluated on subsequent, unseen "testing" data, adapting as market conditions evolve.
◦
Statistical Significance: The statistical significance of observed returns will be evaluated using methods like the Monte Carlo permutation method (MCP). This involves randomly pairing rule output values with scrambled historical market data to generate a sampling distribution for a "useless rule," against which the actual strategy's performance can be compared to determine if its edge is statistically significant. The magnitude of data mining bias increases with the number of rules tested and the degree of correlation among them.
•
Iterative Process: Strategy development is an ongoing, iterative process involving ideas, distillation into actionable systems, monitoring results, and continuous adaptation.
